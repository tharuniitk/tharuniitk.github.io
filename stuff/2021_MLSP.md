## Registration Note: 
- I am planning to have around 50 UGs and rest all PGs. 
- No limit on the number of PGs.
- For UGs (any year):
  - First come first serve.
  - Anyone who has done no other ML course will be given preference; please write in the remarks "No other ML course". *Please do not email me.*

## Course Objectives:
  This course aims at introducing the students to
  machine learning (ML) techniques used for various signal
  processing applications. There will be spectral processing techniques 
  for analysis and transformation of audio signals. The lectures will
  focus on mathematical principles, and there will be coding based
  assignments for implementation. Prior exposure to ML is not
  required. The course will be focused on applications in audio signal processing, and the theory will be tailored towards that end. 

## Pre-requisites:
- Digital signal processing (EE301A or equivalent)(If you have not done it, you will have to learn it. EE200 may also help.)
- Basics of Programming (ESc101 or equivalent)

The course will need a strong background in linear algebra and probability theory.

## Topics:

- Linear Algebra Refresher                  
- Programming Basics: Python and bash scripting
- Digital Signal Processing for audio 
- Probability Theory Refresher 
- Machine Learning basics                   
- Neural Networks      
- Music Information Retrieval 
- Speech Recognition   
- Other applications in audio processing: E.g., acoustic event detection, speaker diarization, music genre classification, auto-tagging, query by humming, melody estimation, etc.

**Plagiarism Penalty:**<br>
As heavy as possible. Zero-tolerance policy.

## References:
  This course will take excerpts from some standard books on machine
  learning and signal processing. But it will largely be based on
  articles and research papers in ML and SP conferences (e.g., ICASSP,
  NeurIPS, ICML, Interspeech, ISMIR, etc.) and journals (e.g., IEEE
  TASLP, JMLR, IEEE PAMI, etc.).
