## Course Objectives:
This course aims at introducing the students to
advanced topics in machine learning (ML). 
The course will begin with lessons on programming
that is needed to enable one to efficiently implement ML
algorithms.
The lectures will focus on mathematical principles, and there will be coding based assignments for implementation. 

<!--
## Registration: (Updated on 23 Nov, 10AM)

- No more space for UG students.
- All PG students will be accepted and are encouraged to apply.
- For auditing the course, please send a request to rashmiy@iitk.ac.in.
-->

## Pre-requisites:
- Basic course on machine learning (EE698V or equivalent)
- Digital signal processing (EE301A or equivalent)
- Basics of Programming (ESc101 or equivalent)

The course will need a strong background in linear algebra and probability theory.

## Topics:

- Data structures and Algorithms
- Deep Neural Networks
- Generative Modeling
	- Random sampling (Monte Carlo methods)
	- Variational Auto Encoders
	- Generative Adversarial Networks
	- Normalizing Flows
- Time Series Modeling
	- Dynamic Programming

## Grading Scheme
1. Continuous Assessment – 20% <br>
Assignment - 6.7%, Quiz - 13.3%
2. Mid-semester Exam – 33.3% <br>
Written exam
3. Project – 46.7% <br>
4. Bonus: Demo 5%, Paper 5%

### Details of project:
- The project presentations will include an individual viva too to assess each individual member's contribution.
- Project presentations will be held from **13 May onwards**. We will release slots which you can fill.
- Students with difficulties, such as COVID complications, can contact the instructor for an extension in deadline (submission by 17 May, presentation on 18 May). Subject to instructor's approval.
<!-- - If you think you have done significant work, worth a paper, email me by **3rd May** to discuss about the upcoming conferences. -->
- if you submit a project demo, you will get extra 5%. Demo means showing your performance (variant goal) on real data in a live run. It should be impressive. E.g.,
  - Melody extraction: take real songs
  - Speaker diarization: record yourself and/or take a real recording from a meeting (TV or movie)
  - Audio event detection: record yourself and/or take a real recording (TV or movie)
- Presentations assessment breakup:

| Details | Marks (out of 35) |
|--|--|
| Problem definition: straightforward + variant | 5 marks |
| No. of methods used (using available libraries) | 1 mark/method |
| No. of methods used (self implemented) | 5 marks/method |
| Report (up to 4 pages + references) Template: https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/PaperInformation/StyleFiles | 10 marks |
| Codes (readable + reproducible) | 10 marks |

### Plagiarism Penalty:<br>
As heavy as possible. Zero-tolerance policy.

<!--
## Projects
- Group of 2-3 students
- We will provide the datasets - students can choose or design problems around them
-->
## References:
  This course will take excerpts from some standard books on machine
  learning and signal processing. But it will largely be based on
  articles and research papers in ML and SP conferences (e.g.,
  NeurIPS, ICML, Interspeech, ICASSP, etc.) and journals (e.g., IEEE
  TASLP, JMLR, IEEE PAMI, etc.).
