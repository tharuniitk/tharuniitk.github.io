## Course Objectives:
This course aims at introducing the students to the fundamentals of digital signal processing useful for various signal processing applications. The lectures will focus on mathematical principles and the intuitive understanding behind, and there will be coding based assignments for implementation. The course will include some applications in audio and image processing.

## Mode:
- The classes will be held via Zoom. Sometimes, the pre-recorded lecture videos will be posted on MooKIT.
- There will be 2 major quizzes - 18th June and 16th July, both Friday.

<!--
## Registration: (Updated on 23 Nov, 10AM)

- No more space for UG students.
- All PG students will be accepted and are encouraged to apply.
- For auditing the course, please send a request to rashmiy@iitk.ac.in.

## Pre-requisites:
- Signals and Systems (EE200A)

## Topics:

- Introduction to digital/discrete-time signals
- Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems
- Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)
- Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Z-transform
- Structures of Discrete-time Systems

## References:
This course will use some standard books on digital signal processing. The main textbook will be:
- Digital Signal Processing: A Computer-Based Approach - by Sanjit K. Mitra

Other books are:
- Discrete time signal processing (3rd ed.) – by Oppenheim and Schafer
- Digital Signal Processing (4th ed.) – by Proakis and Manolakis
